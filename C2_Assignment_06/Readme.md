## Problem Statement

Given weights and values of n items we have to design an algorithm to find out the maximum value subset of the values of final items which must be included in the knapsack such that the total value of the weight of the final items included in the knapsack should be less than or equal to the given capacity of the knapsack

```

Input : 
```
Wt[] : 6 4 6 1 4
Val[] : 3 9 2 1 6
```
output : 
```
Maximum value of the items included in the knapsack such that the weight of the items included does not exceed the given weight of the knapsack.
```

### Test Cases
```
Test Case-1

Input: 
Wt[]: 10,20,30 
Val[]: 60,100,120

Output:
220

Test Case-2
Input: 
Wt[]: 6 4 6 1 4
Val[] : 3 9 2 1 6

Output:
10
```



### Theory
In this problem , we have to maximize the value of the items included in the knapsack such that the weight of the items included does not exceed the given weight of the knapsack.
The given problem hasâ€“
1)	Overlapping sub-problems of recalculating the total value sum of the items included in the knapsack for a given limit of the knapsack.
2)	Optimal substructure property i.e., the given problem can be solved by solving the sub problems of the problem.

### Analysis

**Time Complexity**
<br>
The algorithm-1 computes every possible subsets to find the solution to the main problem hence it takes O(2^n) time.
The algorithm-2 does not computes the solutions to the overlapping sub-problems instead looks for them in the lookup table which stores the values of sub-problems which occurred before, hence it takes O(n*cap) time.

**Space Complexity**
<br>
The algorithm-1 uses O(1) auxillary space as no extra data structure is required.
The algorithm-2 uses O(n*cap) auxillary space for the lookup table.
